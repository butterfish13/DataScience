# DataScience ML Projects
 A repository that will contain notebooks on Python programming, data manipulation, visualization, machine learning and natural language processing projects.
 
 # Books
 A couple books and reference materials I used to create this repo:
 Machine Learning Engineering [link](www.mlebook.com/wiki/doku.php)
 Machine Learning Yearning [link](https://github.com/ajaymache/machine-learning-yearning/blob/master/full%20book/machine-learning-yearning.pdf)
 
 # Libraries Overview
 The following libraries will be used in these notebooks because they are popular, comprehensive and most used in teaching videos and other materials I have come across:
 
    NumPy: scientific computing tool used for array or matrix operations.

    Pandas: great and simple tool for analyzing and manipulating data from a variety of different sources.

    Matplotlib: data visualization tool used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

    Seaborn : data visualization tool built on top of Matplotlib which is pretty simple to use.

    Scikit-Learn: library used for building machine learning models from scratch, Scikit-Learn makes it easy to use classical models in a few lines of code.
    
    TensorFlow and Keras for neural networks: TensorFlow is a popular deep learning framework used for building models suitable for different fields such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Keras is a high level API of TensorFlow.
